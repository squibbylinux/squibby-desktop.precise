= Documentation =

We need a consistent policy for -doc. At the least, any -doc package produced by a source package that also generates a binary package in one of our seed lists should absolutely go into supported.

# * doc-linux-html          # ColinWatson; basic HOWTOs and stuff from LDP
# * manpages-dev            # ColinWatson
# * diveintopython-zh
# * autoconf-doc
# * automake1.8-doc
# * automake1.9-doc
# * automake1.10-doc
# * packaging-guide
# * %texlive-doc
# * texlive-font-utils
# * texlive-bibtex-extra
# * texlive-fonts-extra
# * texlive-publishers

These *-doc packages are in separate source packages, so Extra-Includes won't catch them and they need to be listed explicitly.

# * automake1.8-doc
# * automake1.9-doc
# * bison-doc
# * diff-doc
# * gawk-doc
