Most of what was formerly in the supported seed is now in the dvd seed. This
seed now includes some things that are too big for a DVD, and of course also
inherits from everything else.

= Rescued from Extra =

 * Extra-Include: *-dbg *-debug *-dev *-doc *-docs *-gcj

... and some miscellaneous exclusions for things we don't want to drag in
automatically (note that Extra-Exclude *only* prevents packages from being
included due to matching Extra-Include patterns, and has no other effect):
